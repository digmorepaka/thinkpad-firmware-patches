# ThinkPad UEFI firmware patches collection

## Applying

1. Obtain a UEFI dump 
  - Dump your firmware with an SPI flasher 
  - or get a `bios` region binary from Lenovo's update package
2. Download appropiate patches.txt and comment/uncomment wanted patches in patches file for your model.
3. Use [LongSoft's UEFIPatch](https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool/releases) to apply them to your rom.
4. Fix tamper protection
  - To get a working TPM use [Thrimbor's uefi-sign](https://github.com/thrimbor/thinkpad-uefi-sign) for xx20, xx30, and xx40 ThinkPads. 
  - For xx75, xx85 [sibrazdic's utility](https://github.com/sibradzic/UEFI-playground/blob/master/fix_vendor_hashes.py)
  - For soldered xx40 and onwards replace `4C 4E 56 42 42 53 45 43 FB` with `4C 4E 56 42 42 53 45 43 FF` on the previously patched binary with a hex editor such as [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/) or [wxHexEditor](https://www.wxhexeditor.org/)
5. Flash back your successfully patched binary

## Reporting compatibility

Open a new issue with the following table:

| Model | T430 |
| --- | --- |
| Patchset | Default for generation |
| TPM | Yes, thinkpad-uefi-sign |
| Notes | DDR3-1066/800 speed limiter makes machine unbootable and is a non-volatile setting | 


## Submitting patchset

Open a pull request with the patchset added and the following table in comment:

| Model | X131e |
| --- | --- |
| TPM | Haven't tested |
| Notes | Different whitelist patch | 


Patches are standard UEFIPatch format, mention what it does, what machine it is for, who made it(your name if you did, if you found it on a forum mention OP's name) for special patchsets make sure they are uncommented by default. Example:

```
# LenovoWmaPolicyDxe | WL removal | ripped from nephiel | x131e 3.01
# uncomment to use
#79E0EDD7-9D1D-4F41-AE1A-F896169E5216 10 P:100BC841390B0F84:100BC841390B90E9
